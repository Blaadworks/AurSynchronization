# AurSynchronization
## Description
Allows you to easily automate package updates on AUR.
It may work in a few narrow cases at the moment, but it works.

Job Features:
- Requires a pre-existing package on AUR
- Works with only one target â€” the repository in which the action resides
- Some settings such as build or deployment logic will have to be changed manually
